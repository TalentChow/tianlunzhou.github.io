Welcome! I am Tianlun, a Ph.D. student in the [School of Communication](https://www.comm.hkbu.edu.hk/comd-www/english/front/index.htm) at [Hong Kong Baptist University](https://www.hkbu.edu.hk) (HKBU), supervised by [Prof. Kenneth Paul TAN](https://www.kennethpaultan.net/), [Prof. Xinzhi ZHANG](https://drxinzhizhang.com/) (CityU of HK), and [Prof. Jingyuan SHI](https://imd.hkbu.edu.hk/faculty-member/Dr-SHI-Jingyuan.html). 

My research interests include **digital journalism**, **political communication**, **human-computer interaction**, **information & communication technology**, and **computational social science**. I am interested in using quantitative methods (e.g., surveys and experiments) as well as computational methods to study how digital media and its products (e.g., online news) influence the public’s perceptions of the world and the process of democracy in different societies. In addition, I am interested in how people interact with AI and the mechanisms of their interactions. 

My studies have been presented at the Annual Conference of the International Communication Association (ICA), the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (AEJMC), and the International Association for Media and Communication Research (IAMCR). 

I obtained an M.Sc. in AI and Digital Media with *Distinction* from the School of Communication at Hong Kong Baptist University, and an M.A. in Ethics and Public Affairs with *Distinction* from the Faculty of Arts at Hong Kong Baptist University.
